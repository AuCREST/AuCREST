March 2025

- Two of our papers were accepted at [Voting'25](https://fc25.ifca.ai/voting/):

    - [3+ Seat Risk-Limiting Audits for Single Transferable Vote
      Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14803)
    - [Doing More With Less: Mismatch-Based Risk-Limiting
      Audits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16104)

- We have released a preprint of our latest method for calculating margins of
  victory for STV elections:

    - [Efficient Lower Bounding of Single Transferable Vote Election
      Margins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14847)


February 2022

- Our work on risk limiting audits for Ranked Pairs elections has been
accepted to the VOTING'23 workshop.

September 2022

- Our work on using Dirichlet-Tree models for ballot-polling audits
of IRV elections was presented at the first International Workshop on
Election Infrastructure Security (EIS'22).

October 2022

- It's time for the 8th International Joint Conference on Electronic
Voting (EVOTE-ID'22)! Our team is presenting work on initial steps toward
using Dirichlet-Tree models for IRV post-election audits.

May 2022

- Our work on risk limiting audits for 2-seat STV elections was 
presented at VOTING'22!

January 2022

- This past year our team has explored risk-limiting audit
methodologies for both party-list proportional and Hamiltonian elections. We
have also been successful in our ARC Discovery Project application on post-election
audits for Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections!

December 2021

- In an early Christmas present, our team has been awarded an ARC
Discovery Project grant. This project will focus on developing post-election
audit methodologies for Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections.

January 2021

- Despite the COVID-19 pandemic sending us Melbournians home for the
majority of the year in 2020, this past year has been a busy one on the election
auditing and analysis front. We presented three papers at EVOTE-ID'20, winning a
best paper award for 'You can do RLAs for IRV' summarising the first pilot of
our methodology for risk-limiting audits of IRV elections. Early in the year, we
presented work at IAAI on exploring whether certain mistakes, such as lost ballot
boxes, could have had caused specific candidates to lose a seat in the context
of STV elections.
